# 👋 About Me

I am **Dan Shi**, a Ph.D. Candidate in the School of Computer Science and Technology at **Tianjin University**, advised by **Prof. Deyi Xiong**.

My research focuses on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, with particular interests in **LLM post-training**, **safety alignment**, **mechanistic interpretability**, and **reinforcement learning for LLMs**. My recent work aims to understand *why reinforcement learning generalizes better than supervised fine-tuning*, develop efficient safety alignment methods against jailbreak attacks, improve multilingual safety alignment, and interpret internal representations of large language models.

I am currently a **Research Intern** at the **ERNIE Foundation Model Team, Baidu**, and previously worked as a **Visiting Researcher** at the **German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)**.

I have published first-author papers at **ICML, ACL, ACL Findings, NeurIPS, AAAI, and DASFAA**.
